<p><em>"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."</em> â€” Frederick Douglass</p>

<p>The Justice Party works on its founding documents in a democratic way, on GitHub.  This page allows people to read those documents and get involved.</p>
