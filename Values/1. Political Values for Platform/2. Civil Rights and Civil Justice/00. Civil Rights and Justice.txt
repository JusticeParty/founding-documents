Civil Rights are those rights which should exist for all adult citizens of our national political community. Many of these rights are articulated in our Bill of Rights. Others are implied in lesser laws and the traditions of our society. 
Civil Justice refers to justice with respect to civil rights and particularly to the social relations which constitute our political community. 
The Justice Party strongly believes that all adult citizens should have equal civil rights, regardless of gender, sexual identity, race, ethnicity, religion, creed, government position, or other status, except being of majority age.
